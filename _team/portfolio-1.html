She then completed her master's degree (2013) and doctorate (2016) in physics at UC Santa Barbara. 
            Copp studies how soft-matter building blocks can be used to build novel nanomaterials that generate and/or control light, with an aim to revolutionize technologies in energy and medicine. At UCI, her lab focuses on block copolymer-directed assembly of photonic nanomaterials and on DNA-directed assembly of metallic clusters and nanostructures, as well as methods to expedite nanomaterials discovery using high-throughput experiments and tools from machine learning. 
            Copp was a Hoffman Distinguished postdoctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she also held a UC President's postdoctoral fellowship, a L'Oreal USA for Women in Science fellowship, and a LANL Director's postdoctoral fellowship. At UCI, she holds a Samueli Faculty Development Chair.</p>>
